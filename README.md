# MNIST-Digit-recognition-using-MapReduce
Major Project, BE Computer, TU

The system recognizes MNIST hand written digits and is built with distributed DBNs and sequential feed-forward and back-propagation algorithm. Distributed paradigm was obtained using hadoop, a big data platform. 

Note: The code consists of three parts. 
  1. DBN with MapReduce
  2. Sequential Feed-Forward and Back-Propagation ALgorithm
  3. Testing 

For giving MNIST image as input, we used library which isn't available in given code.
